 Excuse my interruption, but it looks like this app
 does not have a project-wide "migrate" setting configured yet.
 (perhaps this is the first time you're lifting it with models?)

 In short, this setting controls whether/how Sails will attempt to automatically
 rebuild the tables/collections/sets/etc. in your database schema.
 You can read more about the "migrate" setting here:
 http://sailsjs.org/#!/documentation/concepts/ORM/model-settings.html?q=migrate

 In a production environment (NODE_ENV==="production") Sails always uses
 migrate:"safe" to protect inadvertent deletion of your data.
 However during development, you have a few other options for convenience:

 1. safe  - never auto-migrate my database(s). I will do it myself (by hand)
 2. alter - auto-migrate, but attempt to keep my existing data (experimental)
 3. drop  - wipe/drop ALL my data and rebuild models every time I lift Sails

What would you like Sails to do?

info: To skip this prompt in the future, set `sails.config.models.migrate`.
info: Usually this is done in a config file (e.g. `config/models.js`),
info: or as an override (e.g. `sails lift --models.migrate='alter').

warn: ** DO NOT CHOOSE "2" or "3" IF YOU ARE WORKING WITH PRODUCTION DATA **

prompt: ?:  2

 Temporarily using `sails.config.models.migrate="alter"...
